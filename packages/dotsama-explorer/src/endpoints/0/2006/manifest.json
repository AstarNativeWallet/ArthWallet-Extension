  "description": "Astar (previously Plasm) is a Substrate Runtime Module Library which allows developers to add Plasma functions to their Substrate chain. By adding a Astar (previously Plasm) Substrate Runtime Module Library, you can get scalable blockchains within a few minutes. Some people might not know Substrate Runtime Module Library. Basically speaking, Substrate consists of 2 components, Substrate Core and Substrate Runtime Module Library aka SRML. We can customize Substrate Core with SRML and make an original Substrate chain. Other people might not know Plasma. Plasma is a layer2 scaling solution which makes it possible for scalable computation by structuring economic incentives to operate the blockchain autonomously without the operatorâ€™s management. Ideally, it brings infinite scalability into your blockchain.",
